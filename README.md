# Did I Hike That?

## A handy tracker for the trails you've travelled

This web application provides a nice way to record hikes you've 
taken. It was born out of a desire by my spouse and I to answer questions like, 'When was the last time we did this 
trail?' or, 'What was the weather like around this time in prior years?'.

It allows you to record the trail name, a description, a roster of people who went, 
photos, plus things like the conditions, crowd size, etc. Useful on desktop and mobile browsers.

The front end is based on [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and uses a Node.js [back end service](https://github.com/thisiscmt/did-i-hike-that-api), 
all written in TypeScript. Both are currently works in progress.
